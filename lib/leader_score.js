// 3-bucket prorated leader scoring model.
//
// Each NJY Leader's score decomposes into three normalised buckets:
//
//   Team Performance (60%)  — coord roll-up: sum(coord pts) / coord_count
//   Team Coverage    (25%)  — % of the leader's coords with ANY activity
//                             today (chants OR follow-ups OR any point-
//                             earning event), scaled 0-100
//   Leader Touch     (15%)  — leader-personal actions logged in
//                             leader_touch_actions (see schema 0010)
//                             raw sum, capped at TOUCH_NORM for the bar.
//
// The final score is a weighted combination of the three bars. Buckets
// are exposed individually so the UI can render three mini progress
// bars, and the composite is exposed as `total_score` for ranking.
//
// The intent (per user's spec): prorate so a leader with 6 coords and
// three active isn't buried under a leader with 15 coords and three
// active. Coverage % + per-coord average both accomplish that.

// Normalising constant for the Leader-Touch bar. 30 pts/day = a
// leader who fires broadcast (+5), updates their coord WA group (+5),
// contacts 3 coords via mesh WA (+9), and attends one event (+10) =
// 29 pts. So 30 is roughly a "great day" ceiling — anything at/above
// hits the 100% bar. Overall board uses TOUCH_NORM_OVERALL for the
// cumulative window (rough guess of a leader's full campaign ceiling).
